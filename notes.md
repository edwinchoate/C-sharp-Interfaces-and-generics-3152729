# Notes

## Ch. 1

_interfaces_ - provide a way to specific a set of related behaviors that can be used by different classes
    
* They describe _behaviors_ instead of objects.
* A class _implements_ an interface
* "This class knows how to perform this kind of behavior." 
* Like a contract
* A C# class can implment multiple interfaces

> All the calling object needs to know is that, if some object implements some interface, then that object can perform the capabilities specified in that interface.

_generics_ - give you a way of defining type-safe data structures in your application without commiting to a specific data type ahead of time

* Commonly used with collection types 
* Enforces that data structure only be filled with one type of data
